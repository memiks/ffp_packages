beautifulsoup4
===
Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround 
projects like screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:

    Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and
Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, 
and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a 
document and extracting what you need. It doesn't take 
much code to write an application
    Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents 
to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have 
to think about encodings, unless the document doesn't 
specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't autodetect one. 
Then you just have to specify the original encoding.
    Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers 
like lxml and html5lib, allowing you to try out different 
parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility. 

Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the 
tree traversal stuff for you. You can tell it "Find all the links"
, or "Find all the links of class externalLink"
, or "Find all the links whose urls match "foo.com"
, or "Find the table heading that's got bold text, then give me that text."

Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed 
websites is now within your reach. 
Projects that would have taken hours take only minutes with Beautiful Soup.

dtach
===
dtach - A program that emulates the detach feature of screen
dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen, 
allowing you to run a program in an environment that is protected from 
the controlling terminal and attach to it later. 
dtach does not keep track of the contents of the screen, and thus works 
best with programs that know how to redraw themselves.

dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its 
support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. 
This makes dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily 
audited for bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in 
environments where space is limited, such as on rescue disks.

dtach has many possible uses, even though it is tiny. With dtach, you can:

    Attach multiple times to the same program. 
Access to the dtach session is controlled through the Unix filesystem 
permissions; thus, you can trivially allow other people to watch your session.
    Run a program in an environment that is protected from 
the controlling terminal. This means that, for instance, the program 
running under dtach would not be affected by the terminal being 
disconnected for some reason.
    Run programs such as emacs, which tend to want full control over the 
terminal. 
dtach mostly acts as a relay, and does not mangle the text between the 
application and your terminal.
    Suspend dtach without suspending the running program. 
dtach can handle the suspend key itself instead of passing it to the 
running program, which may be useful for certain programs such as ircII.

tokyocabinet
===
Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a value. There is neither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or fixed-length array.

Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the following purposes. They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces conventional DBM products.

    improves space efficiency : smaller size of database file.
    improves time efficiency : faster processing speed.
    improves parallelism : higher performance in multi-thread environment.
    improves usability : simplified API.
    improves robustness : database file is not corrupted even under catastrophic situation.
    supports 64-bit architecture : enormous memory space and database file are available.

Tokyo Cabinet is written in the C language, and provided as API of C, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Lua. Tokyo Cabinet is available on platforms which have API conforming to C99 and POSIX. Tokyo Cabinet is a free software licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

cifs-utils
===
The in-kernel CIFS filesystem is generally the preferred method 
for mounting SMB/CIFS shares on Linux. 

More information on Linux CIFS is available at the Linux CIFS VFS site.

The in-kernel CIFS filesystem relies on a set of user-space tools. 

That package of tools is called cifs-utils. 

Although not really part of Samba proper, these tools were 
originally part of the Samba package. 

For several reasons, shipping these tools as part of Samba 
was problematic and it was deemed better to split them off 
into their own package.

Homepage: http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/LinuxCIFS_utils




gnunet
===
GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that does not 
use any centralized or otherwise trusted services. 

A first service implemented on top of the networking layer allows 
anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing. 

Anonymity is provided by making messages originating from a peer 
indistinguishable from messages that the peer is routing. 

All peers act as routers and use link-encrypted connections with 
stable bandwidth utilization to communicate with each other. 

GNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic model to allocate resources. 

Peers in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with respect to resource usage; 
peers that contribute to the network are rewarded with better service. 

GNUnet is part of the GNU project.

Homepage: https://gnunet.org/




rrdtool
===
RRDtool is the OpenSource industry standard, high performance data logging 
and graphing system for time series data. 

RRDtool can be easily integrated in shell scripts, perl, python, ruby, lua 
or tcl applications.

Homepage: http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/index.en.html




duplicity
===
What is it? 

Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes 
and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity 
uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only 
record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup. 
Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they 
will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server. 

The duplicity package also includes the rdiffdir utility. Rdiffdir is an 
extension of librsync's rdiff to directories---it can be used to produce 
signatures and deltas of directories as well as regular files. These 
signatures and deltas are in GNU tar format. 

Homepage: http://duplicity.nongnu.org/index.html




mpc
===
Music Player Daemon

Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side 
application for playing music.

libextractor
===
GNU libextractor is a library used to extract meta data from files of 
arbitrary type. 

It is designed to use helper-libraries to perform the actual extraction, 
and to be trivially extendable by linking against external extractors for 
additional file types. libextractor is a GNU package. 

Our official GNU website can be found at 
http://www.gnu.org/software/libextractor/. 

libextractor can be downloaded from this site or the GNU mirrors.

The goal is to provide developers of file-sharing networks, browsers or 
WWW-indexing bots with a universal library to obtain simple keywords and 
meta data to match against queries and to show to users instead of only 
relying on filenames. 

libextractor contains a shell command extract that, similar to the 
well-known file command, can extract meta data from a file an print 
the results to stdout.

Currently, libextractor supports the following formats: 
HTML, PDF, PS, OLE2 (DOC, XLS, PPT), OpenOffice (sxw), StarOffice (sdw), 
DVI, MAN, FLAC, MP3 (ID3v1 and ID3v2), NSF(E) (NES music), SID (C64 music), 
OGG, WAV, EXIV2, JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, DEB, RPM, TAR(.GZ), ZIP, ELF, 
S3M (Scream Tracker 3), XM (eXtended Module), IT (Impulse Tracker), FLV, 
REAL, RIFF (AVI), MPEG, QT and ASF.

Also, various additional MIME types are detected.

official extension language for the GNU operating system. 

Guile is a library designed to help programmers create flexible 
applications. Using Guile in an application allows the application's 
functionality to be extended by users or other programmers with 
plug-ins, modules, or scripts. Guile provides what might be described as 
"practical software freedom," making it possible for users to customize 
an application to meet their needs without digging into the 
application's internals. 

There is a long list of proven applications that employ extension 
languages. Successful and long-lived examples of Free Software projects 
that use Guile are TeXmacs, LilyPond, and GnuCash. 

Homepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/

protobuf
===
Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism 
for serializing structured data . think XML, but smaller, faster,
and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, 
then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read 
your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using 
a variety of languages. You can even update your data structure 
without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against 
the "old" format.

vim
===
Vim is an advanced text editor that seeks to provide the power of 
the de-facto Unix editor 'Vi', with a more complete feature set. 

It's useful whether you're already using vi or using a different editor. 

Users of Vim 5 and 6 should consider upgrading to Vim 7.

Homepage: http://www.vim.org/




gnulib
===
Gnulib is a central location for common GNU code, intended to be shared 
among GNU packages. GCC has libiberty, but this is hard to disentangle 
from the GCC build tree.

Gnulib takes a different approach. Its components are intended to be 
shared at the source level, rather than being a library that gets built, 
installed, and linked against. Thus, there is no distribution tarball; 
the idea is to copy files from Gnulib into your own source tree.

Gnulib also includes copies of a few files purely for convenience: 
the GNU coding standards, the GNU maintainer information, the GPL and 
other licenses (in Texinfo), assorted configuration scripts, and more. 
The goal is to provide all the common infrastructure needed by GNU packages.

Homepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/




libev
===
libev

A full-featured and high-performance (see benchmark) event loop that is 
loosely modelled after libevent, but without its limitations and bugs. 
It is used in GNU Virtual Private Ethernet, rxvt-unicode, auditd, 
the Deliantra MORPG Server and Client, and many other programs.

Homepage: http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html




Django
===
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid 
development and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django was designed 
to handle two challenges: 
the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements 
of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. 
It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.

Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering 
to the DRY principle.

Homepage: https://www.djangoproject.com/




thttpd
===
 thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.

Simple:
    It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1. Well, maybe a little more than the minimum. 
Small:
    See the comparison chart. It also has a very small run-time size, since it does not fork and is very careful about memory allocation. 
Portable:
    It compiles cleanly on most any Unix-like OS, specifically including FreeBSD, SunOS 4, Solaris 2, BSD/OS, Linux, OSF. 
Fast:
    In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers (Apache, NCSA, Netscape). Under extreme load it's much faster. 
Secure:
    It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine against attacks and breakins from other sites. 

It also has one extremely useful feature (URL-traffic-based throttling) that no other server currently has. Plus, it supports IPv6 out of the box, no patching required. 

Homepage: http://acme.com/software/thttpd/ 




libpar2
===

libxslt
===
Libxslt is the XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project. 
XSLT itself is a an XML language to define transformation for XML. 
Libxslt is based on libxml2 the XML C library dev

People can either embed the library in their application or use xsltproc 
the command line processing tool. 
This library is free software and can be reused in commercial applications 
(see the intro)


Homepage: http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/index.html




libevent
===
The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a 
specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. 
Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts.

libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network 
servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and then add or 
remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop.

Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll, kqueue(2), event ports, 
POSIX select(2), Windows select(), poll(2), and epoll(4). 
The internal event mechanism is completely independent of the exposed event 
API, and a simple update of libevent can provide new functionality without 
having to redesign the applications. 
As a result, Libevent allows for portable application development and provides 
the most scalable event notification mechanism available on an operating system. 
Libevent can also be used for multi-threaded applications, either by isolating 
each event_base so that only a single thread accesses it, or by locked access 
to a single shared event_base. Libevent should compile on Linux, *BSD, 
Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows, and more.

Libevent additionally provides a sophisticated framework for buffered 
network IO, with support for sockets, filters, rate-limiting, SSL, 
zero-copy file transmission, and IOCP. Libevent includes support for 
several useful protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and a minimal RPC framework.

More information about event notification mechanisms for network servers can 
be found on Dan Kegel's "The C10K problem" web page. 

Homepage: http://libevent.org/




parted
===

kyotocabinet
===
Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The 
database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a 
key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable 
length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a 
value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither 
concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash 
table or B+ tree. 

Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one 
million records is 0.9 seconds for hash database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ 
tree database. Moreover, the size of database is very small. For 
example, overhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash database, and 4 
bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability of Kyoto Cabinet is 
great. The database size can be up to 8EB (9.22e18 bytes). 

Kyoto Cabinet is written in the C++ language, and provided as API of 
C++, C, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, and Lua. Kyoto Cabinet is available on 
platforms which have API conforming to C++03 with the TR1 library 
extensions. Kyoto Cabinet is a free software licensed under the GNU 
General Public License. On the other hand, a commercial license is also 
provided. If you use Kyoto Cabinet within a proprietary software, the 
commercial license is required.

zsh
===
 Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a 
powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, 
and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added. 
The introductory document details some of the unique features of zsh. It 
assumes basic knowledge of the standard UNIX shells; the intent is to 
show a reader already familiar with one of the other major shells what 
makes zsh more useful or more powerful. This document is not at all 
comprehensive; read the manual entry for a description of the shell that 
is complete, concise and up-to-date, although somewhat overwhelming and 
devoid of examples. Alternatively, the user guide offers wordy 
explanations of many of the shell's features.

miniupnpc
===
MiniUPnP download zone 

Find on this page the source of miniupnp and some related files. You 
will also find precompiled binaries of the UPnP client sample program 
for windows compiled using MinGW. 

If you just need one of the software installed on your machine, you 
probably don't need to download and compile the source files. It is very 
likely that a package/port already exists for your system/distribution. 
Refer to your system documentation to find how to search and install a 
package/port. Mac OS X does have port systems too : see MacPorts or 
Homebrew or Fink. 

The miniupnpc (client) sources have been successfully compiled under 
Windows XP/vista/etc. (using MinGW or Cygwin), Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, 
NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD, Solaris, MacOS X and AmigaOS. The Makefile of the 
client is made for GNU make : check which version your system have with 
the command "make --version". On some systems, such as OpenBSD, you have 
to use "gmake". Under Windows with MinGW, GNU make is called 
"mingw32-make" and a sligthly modified version of the Makefile should be 
used : Makefile.mingw. Run "mingw32make.bat" to compile. If you have any 
compatibility problem, please post on the forum or contact me by email. 

See OS4Depot for miniupnpc under AmigaOS 4 : 
http://os4depot.net/index.php?function=showfile&file=network/misc/miniup 
npc.lha. 

Dario Meloni has made a Ruby Gem embedding miniupnpc : 
https://rubyforge.org/projects/mupnp. 

The daemon (starting in November 2006) compiles with BSD make under BSD 
and Solaris. To compile the daemon under linux, use "make -f 
Makefile.linux" To compile for OpenWRT please read the README.openwrt 
file. The X-Wrt project is providing precompiled ipkg packages for 
OpenWrt for both OpenWrt White Russian and OpenWrt kamikaze. Check 
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/xwrt/. For White Russian, take a look at this. 
pfSense users are advised to use the miniupnpd port available for their 
system. Recent versions of pfSense include MiniUPnPd in the base system. 
For Linksys WRT54G and WRT54GL owners, Tarifa firmware is another 
alternative to get miniUPnPd running on the router. 

Please read README and LICENCE files included with the distribution for 
further informations. 

The MiniUPnP daemon (miniupnpd) is working under OpenBSD, NetBSD, 
FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, Mac OS X and (Open)Solaris with pf, with IP 
Filter or with ipfw. The linux version uses libiptc which permits to 
access netfilter rules inside the kernel the same way as iptables.

===
GNU libmicrohttpd is a small C library that is supposed to make it easy to 
run an HTTP server as part of another application. 

GNU libmicrohttpd is free software and part of the GNU project.

Key features that distinguish libmicrohttpd from other projects are:

    C library: fast and small
    API is simple, expressive and fully reentrant
    Implementation is HTTP 1.1 compliant
    HTTP server can listen on multiple ports
    Four different threading models (select, poll, pthread, thread pool)
    Supported platforms include GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS X, 
	W32, Symbian and z/OS
    Support for IPv6
    Support for SHOUTcast
    Support for incremental processing of POST data (optional)
    Support for basic and digest authentication (optional)
    Support for SSL3 and TLS (requires libgcrypt and libgnutls, optional)
    Binary is only about 32k (without TLS/SSL support and other optional 
	features)

libmicrohttpd was started because the author needed an easy way to add a 
concurrent HTTP server to other projects. 

Existing alternatives were either non-free, not reentrant, standalone, 
of terrible code quality or a combination thereof. 

Do not use libmicrohttpd if you are looking for a standalone HTTP server, 
there are many other projects out there that provide that kind of 
functionality already. 

However, if you want to be able to serve simple WWW pages from within 
your C or C++ application, check it out.

fontconfig
===
Fontconfig is a library for configuring and customizing font access. 

Fontconfig can:

	discover new fonts when installed automatically, removing a common 
	source of configuration problems.

    perform font name substitution, so that appropriate alternative fonts 
	can be selected if fonts are missing.
    identify the set of fonts required to completely cover a set of languages.
    have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an XML-based configuration 
	file (though with autodiscovery, we believe this need is minimized).
    efficiently and quickly find the fonts you need among the set of fonts 
	you have installed, even if you have installed thousands of fonts, 
	while minimzing memory usage.

    be used in concert with the X Render Extension and FreeType to implement 
	high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered text on a display. 

Fontconfig does not:

    render the fonts themselves (this is left to FreeType or other 
	rendering mechanisms)
    depend on the X Window System in any fashion, so that printer only 
	applications do not have such dependencies

gzip
===
GNU Gzip is a popular data compression program originally written by 
Jean-loup Gailly for the GNU project. 

Mark Adler wrote the decompression part. 

We developed this program as a replacement for compress because of the 
Unisys and IBM patents covering the LZW algorithm used by compress. 

These patents made it impossible for us to use compress, and we needed a 
replacement. The superior compression ratio of gzip is just a bonus.

 M2Crypto

:Maintainer: Heikki Toivonen
:Web-Site: http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto


M2Crypto = Python + OpenSSL + SWIG
------------------------------------

M2Crypto is a crypto and SSL toolkit for Python.

M2 stands for "me, too!"

M2Crypto comes with the following:

- **RSA**, **DSA**, **DH**, **HMACs**, **message digests**,
  **symmetric ciphers** including **AES**,

- **SSL** functionality to implement **clients and servers**.

- **Example SSL client and server programs**, which are variously
  **threading**, **forking** or based on **non-blocking socket IO**.

- **HTTPS** extensions to Python's **httplib, urllib and xmlrpclib**.

- Unforgeable HMAC'ing **AuthCookies** for **web session management**.

- **FTP/TLS** client and server.

- **S/MIME v2**.

- **ZServerSSL**: A **HTTPS server for Zope**.

- **ZSmime**: An S/MIME messenger for **Zope**.

- And much more.

M2Crypto is released under a very liberal BSD-style licence. See 
LICENCE for details.

To install, see the file INSTALL.

Look at the tests and demos for example use. Recommended reading before
deploying in production is "Network Security with OpenSSL" by John Viega,
Matt Messier and Pravir Chandra, ISBN 059600270X.

Note these caveats:

- Possible memory leaks, because some objects need to be freed on the
  Python side and other objects on the C side, and these may change
  between OpenSSL versions. (Multiple free's lead to crashes very
  quickly, so these should be relatively rare.)
    
- No memory locking/clearing for keys, passphrases, etc. because AFAIK
  Python does not provide the features needed. On the C (OpenSSL) side
  things are cleared when the Python objects are deleted.
    

Have fun! Your feedback is welcome.



par2cmdline
===
Parchive: Parity Archive Volume Set

The original idea behind this project was to provide a tool to apply 
the data-recovery capability concepts of RAID-like systems to the posting 
and recovery of multi-part archives on Usenet. 

We accomplished that goal. 

Our new goal with version 2.0 of the specification is to improve. 

It extends the idea of version 1.0 and takes the recovery process 
beyond the file-level barrier. This allows for more effective protection 
with less recovery data, and removes some previous limitations on the 
number of recoverable parts. See Par1 compared to Par2 for a more detailed 
view of the differences.

Because this new approach doesn't benefit from like sized files, 
it drastically extends the potiental applications of PAR. 

Files such as video, music, and other data can remain in a usable format 
and still have recovery data associated with them.

The technology is based on a 'Reed-Solomon Code' implementation that allows 
for recovery of any 'X' real data-blocks for 'X' parity data-blocks present. 

(Data-blocks referring to files OR much smaller virtual slices of files).

The key to this mission is a clean file format specification which provides 
all the necessary capabilities for programs to easily verify and regenerate 
single missing parts out of a set of data-blocks.

openssl
===
The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, 
commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing 
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and 
Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols 
as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. 

The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use 
the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and 
its related documentation.

OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed 
by Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson

The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an Apache-style licence, 
which basically means that you are free to get and use it 
for commercial and non-commercial purposes subject to some simple 
license conditions.

libatomic_ops
===
 The most recent version of this package can be found in the source tree 
for the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector (bdwgc) on Github. It 
should be possible to just extract the libatomic_ops source tree and 
build it independently. Recent versions are identified by bdwgc version 
numbers. 

Provides implementations for atomic memory update operations on a number 
of architectures. This allows direct use of these in reasonably portable 
code. Unlike earlier similar packages, this one explicitly considers 
memory barrier semantics, and allows the construction of code that 
involves minimum overhead across a variety of architectures. 

The package has been at least minimally tested on X86, Itanium, Alpha, 
PA-RISC, PowerPC, and SPARC, with Linux, Microsoft Windows, HP/UX, 
Solaris, and MACOSX operating systems. Some implementations are more 
complete than others. 

It should be useful both for high performance multi-threaded code which 
can't afford to use the standard locking primitives, or for code that 
has to access shared data structures from signal handlers. For details, 
see README.txt in the distribution. 

The most recent version adds support for operations on data of different 
sizes, and adds an optional library providing almost-lock-free stacks 
(see Boehm, "An almost non-blocking stack", also here) and a 
signal-handler-safe memory allocator based on it. See README_stack.txt 
and README_malloc.txt for details. 

Note that experience with this package contributed to the design of C11 
and C++11 atomics, which represent a careful refinement of the API. If 
your platform supports well-implemented C11 or C++11 atomics, please use 
those instead.

libiconv
===
Introduction to libiconv For historical reasons, international text is 
often encoded using a language or country dependent character encoding. 
With the advent of the internet and the frequent exchange of text across 
countries - even the viewing of a web page from a foreign country is a 
"text exchange" in this context -, conversions between these encodings 
have become important. They have also become a problem, because many 
characters which are present in one encoding are absent in many other 
encodings. To solve this mess, the Unicode encoding has been created. It 
is a super-encoding of all others and is therefore the default encoding 
for new text formats like XML. 

Still, many computers still operate in locale with a traditional 
(limited) character encoding. Some programs, like mailers and web 
browsers, must be able to convert between a given text encoding and the 
user's encoding. Other programs internally store strings in Unicode, to 
facilitate internal processing, and need to convert between internal 
string representation (Unicode) and external string representation (a 
traditional encoding) when they are doing I/O. GNU libiconv is a 
conversion library for both kinds of applications.

openssh
===
OpenSSH is a FREE version of the SSH connectivity tools that technical users 
of the Internet rely on. Users of telnet, rlogin, and ftp may not realize 
that their password is transmitted across the Internet unencrypted, but it is. 
OpenSSH encrypts all traffic (including passwords) to effectively eliminate 
eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. 
Additionally, OpenSSH provides secure tunneling capabilities and several 
authentication methods, and supports all SSH protocol versions.

The OpenSSH suite replaces rlogin and telnet with the ssh program, 
rcp with scp, and ftp with sftp. Also included is sshd (the server side of 
the package), and the other utilities like ssh-add, ssh-agent, ssh-keysign, 
ssh-keyscan, ssh-keygen and sftp-server.

OpenSSH is developed by the OpenBSD Project. 
The software is developed in countries that permit cryptography export and 
is freely useable and re-useable by everyone under a BSD license. 
However, development has costs, so if you find OpenSSH useful (particularly 
if you use it in a commercial system that is distributed) please consider 
donating to help fund the project.

OpenSSH is developed by two teams. 
One team does strictly OpenBSD-based development, aiming to produce code
 that is as clean, simple, and secure as possible. 
We believe that simplicity without the portability "goop" allows for better 
code quality control and easier review. 
The other team then takes the clean version and makes it portable (adding 
the "goop") to make it run on many operating systems -- the so-called -p 
releases, ie "OpenSSH 4.0p1".

We sell OpenSSH T-shirts and posters. Sales of these items also help to 
fund development. 
Donations and other contributions have come entirely from end-users.

Please take note of our Who uses it page, which list just some of the vendors 
who incorporate OpenSSH into their own products -- as a critically important 
security / access feature -- instead of writing their own SSH implementation or
purchasing one from another vendor. 
This list specifically includes companies like Cisco, Juniper, Apple, Red Hat, 
and Novell; but probably includes almost all router, switch or unix-like 
operating system vendors. 
In the 10 years since the inception of the OpenSSH project, 
these companies have contributed not even a dime of thanks in support of the 
OpenSSH project (despite numerous requests).

BeautifulSoup
===
Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround 
projects like screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:

    Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and
Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, 
and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a 
document and extracting what you need. It doesn't take 
much code to write an application
    Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents 
to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have 
to think about encodings, unless the document doesn't 
specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't autodetect one. 
Then you just have to specify the original encoding.
    Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers 
like lxml and html5lib, allowing you to try out different 
parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility. 

Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the 
tree traversal stuff for you. You can tell it "Find all the links"
, or "Find all the links of class externalLink"
, or "Find all the links whose urls match "foo.com"
, or "Find the table heading that's got bold text, then give me that text."

Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed 
websites is now within your reach. 
Projects that would have taken hours take only minutes with Beautiful Soup.

swig
===
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages.

SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby.
The list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as 
C#, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI), D, Go language, Java, Lua, Modula-3, OCAML, Octave and R.

Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket, Chicken) are supported. 

SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, 
and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate 
the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. 

SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions. 

SWIG is free software and the code that SWIG generates is compatible with both commercial and non-commercial projects.

What is Xvid?

Xvid is a video codec for PC, whereas codec is an abbreviation for 
[co]der/[dec]oder, hence describes a program to encode and decode digital video.

The purpose of encoding video data is to reduce redundancies â that means to 
make it smaller for faster transmission over computer networks or for more 
efficient storage on computer disks.

Another great feature of MPlayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. 
It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB, but you 
can use GGI, SDL (and this way all their drivers), VESA (on every VESA 
compatible card, even without X11!) and some low level card-specific 
drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and ATI), too! Most of them support software 
or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen. MPlayer 
supports displaying through some hardware MPEG decoder boards, 
such as the Siemens DVB, DXR2 and DXR3/Hollywood+.

MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice big 
antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls. 
European/ISO 8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and 
Korean fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, 
SubRip, OGM, SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS

iptables
===
Netfilter.org is home to the software of the packet filtering framework 
inside the Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernel series. Software commonly associated 
with netfilter.org is iptables.

Software inside this framework enables packet filtering, network address 
[and port] translation (NA[P]T) and other packet mangling. 
It is the re-designed and heavily improved successor of the previous 
Linux 2.2.x ipchains and Linux 2.0.x ipfwadm systems.

netfilter is a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel 
modules to register callback functions with the network stack. 
A registered callback function is then called back for every packet 
that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.

iptables is a generic table structure for the definition of rulesets. 
Each rule within an IP table consists of a number of classifiers 
(iptables matches) and one connected action (iptables target).

netfilter, ip_tables, connection tracking (ip_conntrack, nf_conntrack) 
and the NAT subsystem together build the major parts of the framework.

ImageMagick
===
ImageMagick® is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert 
bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats 
(over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, 
Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror, 
rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply 
various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and 
Bézier curves. 

The functionality of ImageMagick is typically utilized from the command 
line or you can use the features from programs written in your favorite 
language. Choose from these interfaces: G2F (Ada), MagickCore (C), 
MagickWand (C), ChMagick (Ch), ImageMagickObject (COM+), Magick++ (C++), 
JMagick (Java), L-Magick (Lisp), NMagick (Neko/haXe), MagickNet (.NET), 
PascalMagick (Pascal), PerlMagick (Perl), MagickWand for PHP (PHP), 
IMagick (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby), or TclMagick 
(Tcl/TK). With a language interface, use ImageMagick to modify or create 
images dynamically and automagically. 

ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary 
distribution or as source code that you may freely use, copy, modify, 
and distribute in both open and proprietary applications. It is 
distributed under the Apache 2.0 license, approved by the OSI and

mimms
===
mimms is an mms (e.g. mms://) stream downloader

mimms is a program designed to allow you to download streams using the 
MMS protocol and save them to your computer, as opposed to watching them live. 
Similar functionality is available in full media player suites such as Xine, 
MPlayer, and VLC, but mimms is quick and easy to use and, for the time being, 
remains a useful program.

Originally, mimms was forked directly from the last known version of 
mmsclient, which was for years unmaintained. mimms was started with the 
following goals:

* Keep a working copy of "mmsclient" (now "mimms") well maintained
* Fix lots of the bugs that were in mmsclient
* Extend the functionality of the program in useful ways

Since the 2.x series, mimms shares no code with mmsclient, and actually 
does all of it's MMS operations using libmms, a library based off of the 
xine-improved mmsclient code, which is designed to allow multiple 
implementations of MMS clients without requiring a fragmented code base. 
The mimms 3.x series is implemented entirely in python, and is freed from 
the details of the MMS protocol and architecture dependence, and can focus 
on usability.

mimms has only the following major dependencies:

* python (>= 2.5) - <http://www.python.org>
* libmms (>= 0.4) - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libmms>

Source code is hosted in Bazaar at <http://launchpad.net/mimms>.

cksfv
===
Check SFV (Simple File Verification)
Description
Some files that you download will come with a .sfv file. 

This is used to verify that the files that you received are the same 
as the originals. 

cksfv is a program that can use the .sfv file to verify the downloaded files. 

Also, it can be used to create new .sfv files.

IMPORTANT:
Originally this is Bryan Call's project. 

I decided to start maintain this project since I (Heikki Orsila) 
couldn't reach the developer with a 64-bit architecture fix. 

I'd be happy to let him maintain this useful tool, 
if he contacted me.

docbook2X
===
docbook2X is a software package that converts DocBook documents into 
the traditional Unix man page format and the GNU Texinfo format.

It is free software under a MIT-style license.

Notable features include table support for man pages, internationalization 
support, and easy customization of the output using XSLT. 
(Easy, because unlike other converters, the docbook2X stylesheets are 
written in a modular way, and the character escaping and whitespace 
issues with the man-page and Texinfo formats are encapsulated away from 
the user.)

authentication with SSH's so called "interactive keyboard password 
authentication". Most user should use SSH's more secure public key 
authentiaction instead. 

Homepage: http://sshpass.sourceforge.net/




librsync
===
ibrsync is a free software library that implements the rsync remote-delta 
algorithm. 
This algorithm allows efficient remote updates of a file, without requiring 
the old and new versions to both be present at the sending end. 
The library uses a "streaming" design similar to that of zlib with the aim 
of allowing it to be embedded into many different applications.

librsync is currently pre-1.0, with most important functionality working.

librsync is not wire-compatible with rsync 2.x, and is not likely to be in 
the future.

This is a new codebase, designed to allow a fresh start on the problem and 
a cleaner design. 
It may be used in a future version of rsync or a successor project. 
Early steps towards that are visible in Wayne's rZync prototype, and 
Martin's superlifter design.

The librsync project was created by Martin Pool and is now being enhanced 
and finished by the folks you can find on the project page.

The librsync algorithm is based on the well-known and trustworthy rsync 
software by Andrew Tridgell. 

Homepage: http://librsync.sourceforge.net/



fdisk

===
Introduction to sysstat

The sysstat package contains utilities to monitor system performance and 
usage activity. Sysstat contains various utilities, common to many 
commercial Unixes, and tools you can schedule via cron to collect and 
historize performance and activity data.

    iostat(1) reports CPU statistics and input/output statistics for devices, 
partitions and network filesystems.
    mpstat(1) reports individual or combined processor related statistics.
    pidstat(1) reports statistics for Linux tasks (processes) : I/O, CPU, 
memory, etc.
    sar(1) collects, reports and saves system activity information (CPU, 
memory, disks, interrupts, network interfaces, TTY, kernel tables,etc.)
    sadc(8) is the system activity data collector, used as a backend for sar.
    sa1(8) collects and stores binary data in the system activity daily 
data file. It is a front end to sadc designed to be run from cron.
    sa2(8) writes a summarized daily activity report. It is a front end 
to sar designed to be run from cron.
    sadf(1) displays data collected by sar in multiple formats 
(CSV, XML, etc.) This is useful to load performance data into a database, 
or import them in a spreadsheet to make graphs.
    nfsiostat(1) reports input/output statistics for network filesystems (NFS).
    cifsiostat(1) reports CIFS statistics.

libffi
===
What is libffi? Compilers for high level languages generate code that 
follows certain conventions. These conventions are necessary, in part, 
for separate compilation to work. One such convention is the "calling 
convention". The "calling convention" is a set of assumptions made by 
the compiler about where function arguments will be found on entry to a 
function. A "calling convention" also specifies where the return value 
for a function is found. 

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments are 
to be passed to a function. For instance, an interpreter may be told at 
run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a given 
function. Libffi can be used in such programs to provide a bridge from 
the interpreter program to compiled code. 

The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface 
to various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to call any 
function specified by a call interface description at run-time. 

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function interface 
is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in one 
language to call code written in another language. The libffi library 
really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully 
featured foreign function interface. A layer must exist above libffi 
that handles type conversions for values passed between the two 
languages. 

Homepage: http://sourceware.org/libffi/




libgd
===
GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images by programmers. GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are available for Perl, PHP and other languages.

shellinabox
===
Shell In A Box implements a web server that can export arbitrary command line 
tools to a web based terminal emulator. 

This emulator is accessible to any JavaScript and CSS enabled web browser 
and does not require any additional browser plugins. 

Most typically, login shells would be exported this way: 
shellinaboxd -s /:LOGIN

This command starts a web server at http://localhost:4200 that allows users 
to login with their username and password and to get access to their 
login shell.

All client-server communications are encrypted, if SSL/TLS certificates have 
been installed.

libunistring
===
Introduction to libunistring
Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may consist of 
very different scripts . from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi ., with many 
kinds of special characters . accents, right-to-left writing marks, hyphens, 
Roman numbers, and much more. 

But the POSIX platform APIs for text do not contain adequate functions for 
dealing with particular properties of many Unicode characters. 

In fact, the POSIX APIs for text have several assumptions at their base 
which don't hold for Unicode text.

This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and for 
manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.

lvm2
===
 Introduction to LVM2 

The LVM2 package is a package that manages logical partitions. It allows 
spanning of file systems across multiple physical disks and disk 
partitions and provides for dynamic growing or shrinking of logical 
partitions. 

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-7.2 
platform.

scons
===
SCons is an Open Source software construction tool.
that is, a next-generation build tool. 

Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the classic

slang
===
S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer's library designed to allow a developer 
to create robust multi-platform software. 
It provides facilities required by interactive applications such as 
display/screen management, keyboard input, keymaps, and so on. 
The most exciting feature of the library is the slang interpreter that may 
be easily embedded into a program to make it extensible. 
While the emphasis has always been on the embedded nature of the interpreter, 
it may also be used in a stand-alone fashion through the use of slsh, 
which is part of the S-Lang distribution.

Unlike many interpreters, the S-Lang interpreter supports all of the native 
C integer types (signed and unsigned versions of char, short, int, long, 
and long long), and both single and double precision types, as well as a 
double precision complex type. 
Other data types supported by the interpreter include strings, lists, 
associative arrays (hashes), user-defined structures, and multi-dimensional 
arrays of any data-type.

munin
===
 Munin is a networked resource monitoring tool that can help analyze resource trends and 
"what just happened to kill our performance?" problems. 
It is designed to be very plug and play. 
A default installation provides a lot of graphs with almost no work.

In Norse mythology Hugin and Munin are the ravens of the god king Odin. 
They flew all over Midgard for him, seeing and remembering, and later telling him.

"Munin" means "memory".

davfs2
===
Mount a WebDAV resource as a regular file system

Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the 
HTTP-protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote web server. 
davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like a typical 
filesystem, allowing for use by standard applications with no built-in 
support for WebDAV.

davfs2 is designed to fully integrate into the filesystem semantics of 
Unix-like systems (mount, umount, etc.). 
davfs2 makes mounting by unprivileged users as easy and secure as possible.

davfs2 does extensive caching to make the file system responsive, to avoid 
unnecessary network traffic and to prevent data loss, and to cope for 
slow or unreliable connections.

davfs2 will work with most WebDAV servers needing little or no configuration.

davfs2 is developed and tested on GNU/Linux but porting to other free 
operating systems should not be too cumbersome.
