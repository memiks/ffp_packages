Berkeley DB enables the development of custom data management solutions, 
without the overhead traditionally associated with such custom projects. 

Berkeley DB provides a collection of well-proven building-block 
technologies that can be configured to address any application need 
from the hand-held device to the datacenter, 
from a local storage solution to a world-wide distributed one, 
from kilobytes to petabytes.
