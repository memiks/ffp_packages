The in-kernel CIFS filesystem is generally the preferred method 
for mounting SMB/CIFS shares on Linux. 

More information on Linux CIFS is available at the Linux CIFS VFS site.

The in-kernel CIFS filesystem relies on a set of user-space tools. 

That package of tools is called cifs-utils. 

Although not really part of Samba proper, these tools were 
originally part of the Samba package. 

For several reasons, shipping these tools as part of Samba 
was problematic and it was deemed better to split them off 
into their own package.
