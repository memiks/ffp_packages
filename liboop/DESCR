Liboop provides a generic, callback-based event dispatch interface, and 
aims to ease the development of multiplexed, non-blocking, event-driven 
modular applications, components, and libraries under POSIX-based 
operating systems. 

It includes adapters for select(), poll(), the glib event loop, the TCL 
event loop, the W3C libwww, asynchronous DNS, and GNU readline.
