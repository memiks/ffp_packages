ibrsync is a free software library that implements the rsync remote-delta 
algorithm. 
This algorithm allows efficient remote updates of a file, without requiring 
the old and new versions to both be present at the sending end. 
The library uses a "streaming" design similar to that of zlib with the aim 
of allowing it to be embedded into many different applications.

librsync is currently pre-1.0, with most important functionality working.

librsync is not wire-compatible with rsync 2.x, and is not likely to be in 
the future.

This is a new codebase, designed to allow a fresh start on the problem and 
a cleaner design. 
It may be used in a future version of rsync or a successor project. 
Early steps towards that are visible in Wayne's rZync prototype, and 
Martin's superlifter design.

The librsync project was created by Martin Pool and is now being enhanced 
and finished by the folks you can find on the project page.

The librsync algorithm is based on the well-known and trustworthy rsync 
software by Andrew Tridgell.
