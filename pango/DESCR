Pango is a library for laying out and rendering of text, with an emphasis on 
internationalization. 

Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed, though most of the 
work on Pango so far has been done in the context of the GTK+ widget toolkit. 

Pango forms the core of text and font handling for GTK+-2.x.
