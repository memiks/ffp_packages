 Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a 
powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, 
and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added. 
The introductory document details some of the unique features of zsh. It 
assumes basic knowledge of the standard UNIX shells; the intent is to 
show a reader already familiar with one of the other major shells what 
makes zsh more useful or more powerful. This document is not at all 
comprehensive; read the manual entry for a description of the shell that 
is complete, concise and up-to-date, although somewhat overwhelming and 
devoid of examples. Alternatively, the user guide offers wordy 
explanations of many of the shell's features.
